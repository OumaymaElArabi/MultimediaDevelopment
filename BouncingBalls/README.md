### **Bouncing Balls**

This is a game that generates raining balls inside a canvas. The player has to catch the falling balls using a moving rectangle.

The steering is done using keyboard right & left arrows.

If the player catches a ball, it bounces back and the player's score will increase by one point, but in case he or she misses it, the ball will be generated from the top all over again and his/her score will be decreased by one point & one "life".

If the player misses more than 5 balls, he/she loses all of his shots and the game is over.
